# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Data & Servers

Added Nodejs server (server.js)
Added "proxy": "http://localhost:8000" to package.json
The server contains JSON data, GET and POST routes.
Added data.json to public folder.

Fetching the data on the Home page with GET request from the JSON file.
Fetching the Product details data on the ItemDetails page with POST request with the product id from the server.
Fetching the similar products data on the ItemDetails page with GET request from the server.

## React Router
using "react-router-dom": "^5.3.4"
Routes: [/, /register, /login, /products/:id, *]

## JS Functions
Added marketFunctions.js.
The file includes Functions to validate the register and login inputs [ValidateEmail, CheckPassword, CheckEmpty, checkDate, checkGender]

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
